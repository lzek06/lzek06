- 👋 Hi, I’m @lzek06

👀 I’m interested in robotics, general knowledge, health, documentaries, movies, and music.
🌱 I’m currently learning Spanish.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to robotics, film analysis, and any topics involving tech or media.
📫 You can reach me at luarazequini5@gmail.com.
😄 Pronouns: she/her
⚡ Fun fact: I’m always analyzing visual and sound patterns in movies and music—spotting camera techniques, color schemes, and breaking down all the layers of sound!
